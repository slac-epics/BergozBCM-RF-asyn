R2.0.1:  feb/22/2022 Marcio Donadio
         - Upgraded asyn/R4.39-1.0.1 and streamdevice/R2.8.9-1.2.1 only for the
           IOC application example as the main module doens't need asyn or
           stream device.

R2.0.0:  jul/24/2019 Marcio Donadio
         - Database and protocol file changed to use 2 Asyn ports to the same
           USB in order to separate trafic-from and trafic-to. Asyn was not
           able to process so many receiving messages and the sending ended-up
           in timeout.
         - Module completely refactored to the Area Detector style, where the
           IOC app example is detached from the module, so the module is kept
           the simplest possible.
